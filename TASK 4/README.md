### **DATA SCIENCE PROJECT : SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON**


## **Objective:**The objective is to predict future sales, considering factors like advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.
Sales prediction is crucial for businesses, enabling them to optimize advertising strategies and maximize sales potential.

## *Methology*

**Import Libraries:** Python offers a rich ecosystem of libraries for machine learning and data analysis.Commonly used libraries include pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and statsmodels.

**Loading Data:** Data loading is the initial step, often involving the import of datasets containing historical sales and related factors.
Data should be structured, cleaned, and prepared for analysis.

**Data Preprocessing:**Data preprocessing involves tasks like handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling numerical features.
Clean data is essential for accurate model building.

**EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** EDA is critical for understanding the dataset and relationships between variables.
It includes tasks like data visualization, summary statistics, and identifying patterns.

**Correlation Matrix:** A correlation matrix helps quantify the relationships between variables.It's a valuable tool to identify which features are strongly correlated with the target variable (e.g., 'Sales').

**Model Building:** Model building includes selecting an appropriate algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression or Logistic Regression) for sales prediction.
The model is trained on historical data to capture relationships between features and sales.

**Logistic Regression:**Logistic Regression is a common choice when the target variable is categorical (e.g., binary classification).
It's suitable for predicting outcomes like customer purchases or no purchases.

**Model Evaluation:** Model evaluation is essential for assessing predictive performance.
Common metrics for regression tasks include Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2).
Classification models like Logistic Regression may use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score,Cross-Validation Scores,Mean CV Score.

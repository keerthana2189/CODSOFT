# CODSOFT
## DATA SCIENCE PROJECT : MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON

## Objective
The project's primary objective is to create a machine learning model that can accurately estimate movie ratings based on various features, including genre, director, and actors.

### Methods/Steps

Data Exploration
The project involves thorough data exploration to understand the dataset's characteristics, including missing values, data types, and statistical summaries.

#Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps are crucial in preparing the dataset for modeling. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and performing feature engineering.

##Feature Engineering
Feature engineering plays a significant role in improving model performance. In this project, we performed label encoding and one-hot encoding for categorical features and extracted relevant information from actors' columns.

##Model Building 
Linear Regression is chosen as the machine learning model in this project. The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset to predict movie ratings.

##Model Evaluation
Model evaluation is essential to assess its performance. Common regression metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared are used to evaluate the accuracy of the rating predictions.

##Model Deployment  
Depending on the project's goals, model deployment may be considered. Deploying the model allows it to be used in real-world applications, such as movie recommendation systems.

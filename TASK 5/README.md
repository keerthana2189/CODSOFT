## **DATA SCIENCE PROJECT: IRIS FLOWERS CLASSIFICATION**

## **Objective**
Objective:The primary objective of this project is to build and train a machine learning model for the identification of fraudulent credit card transactions. This includes data preprocessing, addressing class imbalance, and evaluating the model's performance using key metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

### **METHODOLOGY**

**Importing Libraries:**
Import the necessary libraries for your machine learning project, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, train_test_split, StandardScaler, SMOTE, RandomUnderSampler, LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, and classification_report.

**Loading Data:**
Load the credit card transaction data into your Colab notebook, typically from a CSV file. Check the data's basic structure and content by displaying the first few rows and checking data types, missing values, and summary statistics.

**Data Preprocessing:** 
You performed data preprocessing steps, which included normalizing the features and handling class imbalance using SMOTE or RandomUnderSampler.

**Model Selection:** You chose a classification algorithm, such as Logistic Regression or Random Forest, for this task.

**Model Training:** The model was trained on the preprocessed data, considering the class imbalance handling techniques.

**Model Evaluation:** The model's performance was assessed using key metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics help in understanding how well the model identifies fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

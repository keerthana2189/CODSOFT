## Objective:

Predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features like age, gender, ticket class, fare, and more.
## Methodlogy:

**Import Libraries:**
Import essential libraries for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning:
Pandas for data manipulation.
NumPy for numerical operations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
Scikit-learn for machine learning.

**Loading Data:**
Load the Titanic dataset, which can be obtained from various sources, into a Pandas DataFrame.

**Data Preprocessing:**
Data preprocessing involves a series of steps to prepare the data for analysis and modeling:
Handling missing values in columns
Encoding categorical variables 
Creating new features
Dropping unnecessary columns

**Data Cleaning:**
Data cleaning involves handling data quality issues:
Dealing with missing values, e.g., filling in missing ages or dropping columns with too many missing values.
Handling outliers or anomalies in the data, if any.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
EDA is the process of understanding the data through visualization and summary statistics:
Plotting histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots to visualize the data.
Analyzing the distribution of features and their relationships.
Investigating correlations between features and the target variable.
Drawing insights about the dataset.

**Model Training:**
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Choose a machine learning model, e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, or random forest.
Train the model on the training data.

**Model Evaluation:**
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics:
Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
